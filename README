# 2023 Advent of Code

This year I have chosen to do the Advent of Code in C. 
I am using this as an opportunity to learn C and further improve my programming skills.

## Usage:

Copy the relevant days input to "input.txt" in the same directory as runner.c
Run the main script:

```bash
make
./runner.exe
```
