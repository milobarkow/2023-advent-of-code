# 2023 Advent of Code

This year I have chosen to do the Advent of Code in C. 
I am using this as an opportunity to learn C and further improve my programming skills.

## Usage:

Copy the relevant days input to "input.txt" in the same directory as main.c
Run the make file
Run the executable passing in the day to be run as an argument
For example, to run day 10:

```bash
make
./main day
```
